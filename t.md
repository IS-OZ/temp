### 1. Executive Summary & Strategic Intent

This report presents a comprehensive 3-5 year strategic blueprint for the management of Ingredion’s Professional Services category. Analysis of internal data reveals a substantial forecasted spend of approximately **$460 million** for 2024-2025, representing 4.15% of the company's total spend. The most critical finding is the category's extreme supplier fragmentation: **6,024 active suppliers**, with **67.91% of the spend (the "tail") distributed across 6,014 of them**. This fragmentation represents a significant untapped opportunity for value creation.

The core recommendation of this report is to initiate a **strategic supplier rationalization program**. By consolidating the vast tail spend and developing deeper partnerships with a smaller, high-performing supplier base, Ingredion can unlock substantial benefits. Projections based on industry benchmarks indicate potential direct cost savings of **$15.6 million to $31.2 million annually**, complemented by administrative savings of **$2.1 million to $4.2 million** from a reduced supplier footprint.

This strategy is built on a foundation of robust internal data analysis and extensive external market intelligence. It proposes a multi-lever approach focused on:
*   **Supply-Base Rationalization:** Aggressively managing tail spend and consolidating volume.
*   **Demand Management:** Implementing stricter controls and a "make-or-buy" framework.
*   **Value Engineering:** Shifting focus from price to Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).
*   **Automation & Digitization:** Leveraging technology to drive efficiency and data visibility.

**Strategic Intent:** The vision is to transform the Professional Services category from a fragmented, transactional function into a strategic value driver. This will be achieved by establishing a world-class professional services ecosystem that delivers optimal value, drives innovation, fosters sustainable and ethical partnerships, and enhances Ingredion’s agility and competitive advantage through strategic sourcing and digital excellence. The following plan provides a clear, data-backed pathway for Category Managers to execute this vision and deliver impactful, measurable results aligned with Ingredion’s enterprise goals.

### 2. Category Profile & Current State Assessment (Initiation & Research)

**Category Context & Business Importance**
The Professional Services category is critical to Ingredion's operational integrity and strategic advancement. It encompasses a wide array of external expertise—from business consulting and financial services to legal counsel and laboratory testing—that directly supports core functions and innovation pipelines. Representing **4.15% of Ingredion’s overall spend**, this category is not only a significant cost center but also a vital enabler of key corporate initiatives, including digital transformation, global expansion, and achieving cost competitiveness. The current state of this category, however, indicates a substantial opportunity for optimization.

**Current Spend Landscape (2024-2025 Forecast)**
Internal procurement data provides a clear snapshot of the forecasted spend for the 2024-2025 period, totaling **$459.88 million**. This spend is heavily concentrated geographically and spread across several key service types.

*   **Regional Distribution:**
    *   **North America (NA):** 66.67%
    *   **Europe, Middle East, Africa (EMEA):** 21.72%
    *   **Asia-Pacific (APAC):** 11.61%

*   **Top Sub-Categories by Spend:**
    *   PROFESSIONAL SERVICES - OTHERS: 18.58%
    *   BUSINESS CONSULTING: 18.24%
    *   FINANCIAL SERVICES - OTHERS: 15.24%
    *   BANKING & INVESTMENT - OTHERS: 7.59%
    *   CREDIT CARD: 6.49%
    *   BUILDING/PROPERTY INSURANCE: 6.25%
    *   LEGAL SERVICES: 4.28%

**Historical Spend & Initiatives Review**
Analysis of the forecasted spend shows a notable decrease from **$316.47 million in 2024** to **$143.40 million in 2025**. While this may indicate a successful reduction effort or strategic shift, it is more likely reflective of incomplete forecasting for the 2025 period and requires further investigation for accurate trend analysis.

Historically, Ingredion has demonstrated an aptitude for large-scale cost management. The **"Cost Smart SG&A program,"** which concluded in 2021, was a significant cost reduction initiative. It successfully delivered **over $170 million in total savings**, surpassing its revised target of $150 million. While the specific impact on Professional Services was not detailed, the program's success underscores the organization's capability to execute efficiency programs, setting a positive precedent for the strategic recommendations in this report.

**Supplier Base Overview & Fragmentation Analysis**
The most striking feature of the Professional Services category is its highly fragmented supplier base. Ingredion currently engages with **6,024 active suppliers**. The spend distribution is heavily skewed:

*   The **Top 10 suppliers** account for just **32.09%** of the total spend.
*   The single largest supplier, RJ Obrien & Associates LLC, holds a modest **7.57%** share.
*   A substantial **67.91% of the spend** is distributed among the remaining **6,014 suppliers**. This is classified as "tail spend."

This extreme fragmentation points to a decentralized and tactical procurement approach, likely driven by ad-hoc purchasing and a lack of a unified category strategy. <cite source="src-180" /> <cite source="src-177" /> This scenario inherently creates inefficiencies, including increased administrative overhead, reduced negotiating leverage, inconsistent service quality, and limited visibility and control over a significant portion of spend. <cite source="src-285" /> <cite source="src-287" /> Strategic intervention is therefore not just an opportunity but a necessity. Industry benchmarks show that consolidating vendors can yield average cost savings of 10-15% in procurement operations alone. <cite source="src-184" /> <cite source="src-186" />

### 3. Internal Spend & Supplier Landscape Research (Research)

A forensic review of internal data is the foundation for any credible category strategy. This section details the spend profile, identifies critical data gaps that inhibit strategic management, and proposes frameworks to improve data quality and supplier oversight.

**Detailed Spend Analysis & Classification**
The internal spend data for 2024-2025 reveals a classic "long tail" distribution, where a small number of suppliers account for a minority of the spend, while the vast majority of suppliers represent a disproportionately large share. The key high-spend, high-fragmentation areas ripe for consolidation are:

*   **Sub-Category Targets:** "PROFESSIONAL SERVICES - OTHERS" (18.58%), "BUSINESS CONSULTING" (18.24%), and "FINANCIAL SERVICES - OTHERS" (15.24%) are the largest sub-categories and likely contain numerous overlapping or redundant suppliers. Smaller, transactional categories such as "TEMPORARY LABOR" (3.15%) and "ACCOUNTING SERVICES" (3.09%) are also prime candidates for aggregation under fewer preferred providers.
*   **Regional Focus:** With 66.67% of the spend, North America presents the most significant opportunity for initial consolidation efforts to maximize impact.

**Infographics Diagram: Supplier Spend Concentration**
To visually represent this dynamic, an interactive Pareto chart titled **'Ingredion Professional Services: Supplier Spend Concentration (2024-2025)'** is recommended. This chart would plot suppliers on the x-axis (from highest to lowest spend) and use a dual-axis format: the primary y-axis showing individual supplier spend and the secondary y-axis showing the cumulative percentage of total spend. It would starkly illustrate two key data points:
1.  **Concentrated Head:** A clear annotation showing that the **Top 10 Suppliers account for only 32.09% of the total spend**.
2.  **Expansive Tail:** A visual representation of the long, flat curve where the **remaining 6,014 suppliers make up 67.91% of spend**, immediately highlighting the scale of the tail spend management opportunity.

**Contract Review & Specification Assessment**
A significant barrier to effective category management is the absence of structured contractual data. Internal data sources explicitly state that fields for supplier contracts, including **contract IDs, start/end dates, status, and renewal terms, are currently blank**. Furthermore, there is no centralized repository for **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)** or detailed service **specifications**. This lack of fundamental information creates several risks:
*   **Poor Performance Management:** Without defined SLAs, performance cannot be objectively measured.
*   **Inconsistent Quality:** A lack of standardized specifications leads to variability in service delivery.
*   **Reactive Renewals:** Without visibility into contract end dates, negotiations are often rushed and suboptimal.

**Recommendation:** A critical first step is a **data enrichment project**. This involves implementing a Centralized Contract Management System (CMS), mandating standardized contract templates with required data fields, and retroactively populating this information for all strategic and high-spend suppliers.

**Stakeholder Needs & Business Requirements (RAQSCI Analysis - Conceptual)**
The RAQSCI framework is essential for evaluating suppliers beyond cost. However, its application is currently limited by a lack of qualitative stakeholder feedback. Conceptually, for Professional Services, the framework would assess:
*   **Regulatory (R):** Adherence to financial, legal, data privacy, and labor regulations.
*   **Availability (A):** The supplier's capacity and responsiveness to meet project timelines.
*   **Quality (Q):** The accuracy, expertise, and tangible impact of the delivered service.
*   **Service (S):** Communication effectiveness, collaboration, and relationship management.
*   **Cost (C):** The total cost of ownership, including hidden administrative and operational costs.
*   **Innovation (I):** The supplier's ability to introduce new technologies, methodologies, and value-added insights.

**Recommendation:** Implement a systematic process for gathering stakeholder feedback through surveys and structured interviews post-engagement to populate RAQSCI-based supplier scorecards.

**Current Supplier Performance & Relationship History**
The internal data has no explicit information on supplier performance, relationship history, or compliance with Ingredion’s Global Supplier Code of Conduct (GSCC). While risk fields exist, they are blank. This is a critical deficiency. Effective supplier management requires a data-driven understanding of past performance and alignment with corporate values.

**Recommendation:** Ingredion must develop and implement a **Supplier Performance Management (SPM) framework**. This should include:
1.  **Service-Specific KPIs:** Defining measurable metrics for key sub-categories.
2.  **Standardized Scorecards:** To track performance against KPIs and contractual obligations.
3.  **Regular Business Reviews:** A formal cadence for reviewing performance with strategic and preferred suppliers.
4.  **GSCC Compliance Tracking:** Integrating adherence to ethical standards as a core performance metric.

### 5. Strategic Analysis & Opportunity Identification (Analysis)

By synthesizing Ingredion's internal spend profile with external market intelligence, we can identify specific, actionable opportunities for optimization, value creation, and risk mitigation. This analysis forms the strategic core of the transformation plan for the Professional Services category.

**Kraljic Portfolio Analysis for Professional Services**
Segmenting Ingredion's professional services using the Kraljic Matrix provides a framework for developing tailored sourcing strategies. Based on inferred profit impact and supply risk, the sub-categories can be classified as follows:

| **Kraljic Quadrant** | **Sub-categories (Examples)** | **Recommended Sourcing Strategy** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Strategic**<br>(High Profit Impact, High Supply Risk) | Business Consulting (for strategic initiatives), unique R&D services, specialized Legal Services, complex Financial Services. | **Develop long-term, collaborative partnerships.** Focus on co-creation, joint business planning, and shared risk/reward models. Implement rigorous performance management and integrate suppliers into strategic planning cycles. |
| **Leverage**<br>(High Profit Impact, Low Supply Risk) | General Accounting and Audit Services, standard Financial and Banking Services, high-volume Temporary Labor. | **Maximize buying power through competitive tension.** Use RFPs, reverse auctions, and volume consolidation to drive cost optimization and secure favorable terms with high-performing suppliers. |
| **Bottleneck**<br>(Low Profit Impact, High Supply Risk) | Highly specialized Laboratory Testing Services, niche consulting expertise, services required in remote or difficult-to-source locations. | **Ensure supply security and reduce dependence.** Actively seek and qualify alternative suppliers, develop contingency plans, and secure supply with long-term, protective contracts. Explore building in-house capabilities where feasible. |
| **Non-Critical (Routine)**<br>(Low Profit Impact, Low Supply Risk) | General "PROFESSIONAL SERVICES - OTHERS," administrative support, standard training services, event management. | **Streamline and automate the procurement process.** Implement e-catalogues, use P-cards for low-value purchases, and standardize contracts to minimize administrative overhead and improve efficiency. |

**Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Cost/Price Analysis**
To achieve true value, Ingredion must shift its evaluation criteria from upfront price to Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). The current fragmented approach likely overlooks significant hidden costs associated with managing 6,024 suppliers.

*   **TCO Components for Consideration:**
    *   **Direct Costs:** Invoiced service fees.
    *   **Indirect Costs:** Internal resource time for vendor management, onboarding, and project oversight.
    *   **Lifecycle Costs:** Costs related to contract renewals, service transitions, or technology integration/decommissioning.
    *   **Risk-Related Costs:** The financial impact of poor service quality, project delays, or compliance failures.

1.  **Criteria for Selection:** Suppliers will be evaluated against a balanced scorecard including: Performance Excellence, Cost Competitiveness, Strategic Alignment, Innovation Capability, Digital Maturity, Financial Stability, and Compliance with ESG and Ethical Standards. The "10-C model" can provide a useful framework for this evaluation. <cite source="src-137" /> <cite source="src-138" />
2.  **Managing a Reduced Supplier Base:**
    *   **Segmentation:** Tier suppliers as Strategic, Preferred, or Approved, with tailored relationship management plans for each.
    *   **Joint Business Planning:** Conduct annual joint planning sessions with strategic partners to align on goals and innovation roadmaps. <cite source="src-144" />
    *   **Outcome-Based Contracts:** Shift toward contracts that link payment to the value delivered, moving away from purely effort-based models.
    *   **Knowledge Transfer:** Require strategic partners to have formal knowledge transfer mechanisms to help build Ingredion's internal capabilities. <cite source="src-70" />
3.  **Diverse Suppliers:**
    *   **Sourcing Mandate:** Require the inclusion of at least one certified diverse supplier in all relevant RFPs. <cite source="src-149" />
    *   **Enablement:** Actively identify and develop diverse suppliers through partnerships with advocacy groups and participation in matchmaking events. <cite source="src-147" />
    *   **Tracking & Reporting:** Establish clear targets for spend with diverse suppliers and integrate this metric into procurement performance dashboards.
4.  **Ethical Conduct:**
    *   **Supplier Code of Conduct:** Mandate acknowledgment and adherence to Ingredion's code as a prerequisite for doing business.
    *   **ESG Integration:** Embed detailed ESG criteria into the supplier selection and performance review process, using frameworks like EcoVadis assessments to verify credentials. <cite source="src-151" /> <cite source="src-166" />

**Support for Ingredion’s ESG and Digital Transformation Initiatives**

*   **Support for ESG:** This strategy directly supports Ingredion's ESG goals by embedding sustainability and diversity into the procurement lifecycle. By prioritizing ethical suppliers, increasing spend with diverse businesses, and requiring transparency on ESG performance, the Professional Services category will become a key contributor to the company's social and environmental commitments. <cite source="src-159" /> <cite source="src-160" />
*   **Support for Digital Transformation:** The strategy is a catalyst for Ingredion's digital journey. Automating procurement processes creates internal efficiencies. <cite source="src-168" /> Establishing a digital foundation for spend and contract data enables advanced analytics and AI-powered decision-making. <cite source="src-170" /> Furthermore, by prioritizing digitally mature suppliers, Ingredion can leverage their innovation and expertise to accelerate its own transformation. <cite source="src-173" />

**Integration of Findings & Acknowledged Internal Data Gaps**
This strategy is a direct response to the analysis of Ingredion's ~$460 million spend, the severe supplier fragmentation (67.91% tail spend), and the dominance of the North American region. The aggressive rationalization targets are justified by these findings. The strategy also incorporates external best practices for tail spend management, value engineering, and ESG integration. It explicitly acknowledges the current data gaps (incomplete 2025 data, lack of contract details, vague "OTHERS" category) and includes strategic objectives and initiatives—such as digitization and data analytics—designed to close these gaps over the strategy's lifecycle.

*   **Objectives:** Reduce supplier count by 50%, achieve 10-15% cost savings, and establish a panel of 3-5 preferred consulting partners.
*   **Team:** Led by the Category Manager with representatives from Finance, Strategy, and key business units.
*   **Success Metrics:** Cost savings realized, supplier reduction achieved, stakeholder satisfaction score.

**Stakeholder Engagement & Change Management**
Success is contingent on enterprise-wide adoption. A proactive change management plan is essential and must include:
*   **Executive Sponsorship:** Secure visible support from senior leadership.
*   **Clear Communication:** Regularly communicate the "why" behind the changes, highlighting benefits for business units (e.g., faster sourcing, higher quality providers).
*   **Training & Enablement:** Provide comprehensive training on new tools, policies, and processes.
*   **Feedback Channels:** Establish mechanisms for stakeholders to provide input and raise concerns.

**Risk Management & Contingency Planning**
Implementation risks and their mitigation plans include:
*   **Service Disruption during Transition:** **Mitigation:** Phased transition plans with clear cutover dates and parallel operations where necessary.
*   **Internal Resistance:** **Mitigation:** Proactive change management and stakeholder engagement from the outset.
*   **Loss of Niche Expertise:** **Mitigation:** A balanced consolidation approach that retains critical, high-performing niche suppliers.
*   **Consolidated Supplier Underperformance:** **Mitigation:** Robust contracts with strong SLAs and performance clauses, coupled with regular business reviews and having qualified secondary suppliers.

**Data Enrichment Plan**
Addressing the identified data gaps is a foundational priority for Year 1:
1.  **Select & Implement CMS/CLM Tool:** Q4 2025 - Q1 2026.
2.  **Data Gathering Campaign:** Q1 - Q3 2026. Mandate that all business units provide existing contracts and supplier details for upload into the new system.
3.  **RAQSCI Stakeholder Interviews:** Q2 - Q3 2026. Conduct structured interviews with key budget holders to build a baseline of supplier performance and business requirements.

### 8. Performance Measurement & Continuous Improvement (Implementation)

The successful execution of this category strategy requires a robust framework for measuring performance, ensuring accountability, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement. The strategy's impact will be tracked against the established objectives through a balanced set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) & Metrics**
The following KPIs will be used to monitor the health and progress of the Professional Services category:

| Strategic Objective | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) | Target (Year 3) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost Optimization & Value Enhancement** | • Annualized Cost Savings (as % of spend)<br>• Tail Spend Reduction (%)<br>• Spend Under Management (%) | • 5-10% overall savings<br>• 15-20% savings on tail spend<br>• >85% |
| **Supplier Base Optimization** | • Total Number of Active Suppliers<br>• % of Spend with Preferred Suppliers<br>• % of Spend with Diverse Suppliers | • 30-40% reduction from baseline<br>• >80%<br>• 25% increase from baseline |
| **Operational Efficiency & Digitization** | • Average Procurement Cycle Time (days)<br>• % of POs Processed Touchlessly<br>• Contract Compliance Rate (%) | • 30% reduction from baseline<br>• >70% for routine services<br>• >95% |
| **Risk Mitigation & Compliance** | • % of Suppliers with Signed Code of Conduct<br>• Supplier Risk Score (Average)<br>• % of Strategic Suppliers with Contingency Plans | • 100%<br>• Improvement of 15%<br>• 100% |
| **Innovation & Partnership** | • Number of Supplier-Led Innovation Initiatives<br>• Stakeholder Satisfaction Score (CSAT) | • >5 per year<br>• >4.5 out of 5 |

**Reporting & Governance Framework**
*   **Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs):** The Category Council will convene quarterly to review the KPI dashboard, assess progress against the implementation roadmap, and resolve any roadblocks. These sessions will provide a forum for data-driven decision-making and strategic adjustments.
*   **Annual Strategy Refresh:** At the end of each fiscal year, the category strategy will be formally reviewed and updated. This process will incorporate performance data, lessons learned, new stakeholder requirements, and updated external market intelligence to ensure the strategy remains relevant and continues to deliver value.

**Knowledge Management & Feedback Loop**
To support continuous improvement, a centralized knowledge management system (e.g., a SharePoint site or integrated procurement platform module) will be established. This system will serve as a repository for:
*   **Best Practices & Templates:** Standardized RFP templates, SOWs, and contract clauses.
*   **Lessons Learned:** Documented outcomes and key takeaways from all major sourcing projects.
*   **Supplier Performance Data:** Centralized access to supplier scorecards and stakeholder feedback.
*   **Market Intelligence:** A living library of market reports and trend analyses.

This repository will ensure that institutional knowledge is captured and shared, enabling the procurement team to learn from past successes and failures and refine its approach over time.

**Next Iteration & Strategic Review**
This strategic plan is not a static document but a living framework. The annual review cycle will be a critical process for re-evaluating the Kraljic matrix, assessing the performance of the preferred supplier base, identifying new technologies or market trends, and recalibrating objectives for the following year. This iterative process ensures that Ingredion's professional services procurement function remains agile, strategic, and consistently aligned with the evolving needs of the business.
